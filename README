Steps I followed to root my device (with archive link backups for
documentation):

Follow the steps outlined here:

	https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/bullhead/install
	http://archive.is/TzC7s

Additionally:

	Get the factory image for my device.  I used:
	
		https://developers.google.com/android/images#bullhead
		7.1.2 (N2G48C, Aug 2017)
		https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/bullhead-n2g48c-factory-45d442a2.zip

	And then flash the bootloader, radio, and vendor images.  I did
	this to make sure all device peripherals worked (especially
	fingerprint sensor) and to quell the vendor image warning.  These
	commands after `adb reboot-bootloader`:

		fastboot flash radio .\radio-bullhead-m8994f-2.6.37.2.21.img
		fastboot flash bootloader .\bootloader-bullhead-bhz11m.img
		fastboot flash vendor .\vendor.img

	Use http://opengapps.org/?api=7.1&variant=nano#downloadsection for
	GApps.  This should be installed before first reboot, however I forgot
	to do this the first time around and decided to press on to see what
	happens (seemingly nothing bad happened).  I eventually redid the
	install and did it properly.

	I disabled the installation of the Google Dialer in installer.sh for
	openGApps for call recording functionality.  This is provided in the
	open_gapps-arm64-7.1-nano-20171124-mod directory.  As a side note, the
	installer.sh uses black magic and I went a little crazy.

	Disabling it still didn't enable call recording, so I am unsure of what
	is happening with that.  I might try a no GApps install to see if
	that's the issue.

Less detailed henceforth.

Backups:

	I backed up all phone settings.  In order to restore a backup, I would
	need to push the backup to /storage/emulated/0/TWRP/BACKUPS so that
	TWRP can see and restore it.  I pulled the backup from that originally.
	THe internal storage has room to only save one full system backup.

Firewall

Since I have Google Fi, I have to pay for all the data I use.  I wanted a
solution to whitelist apps for data, such as my web browser, since that doesn't
(usually) download in the background.

I downloaded AFWall+ off of the F-Droid store.  Messenger was having an issue
staying blocked, but then I went into settings and enabled IPv6 controls and it
worked like a charm.

The first column is Wifi, and the second is Data.

Google Fi, Hangouts, and SMS apps

For some reason I could send SMS, but not receive it.  I went to
hangouts.google.com, clicked "...", went into settings, and then unticked
"Project Fi/Receive SMS and voicemail in Hangouts" to enable.  I re-enabled it
because I wanted desktop texting functionality.  Apparently you can use SMS or
Hangouts messaging, but not both.

Can't have Google Maps directions with music playing.

I'd like to play music in my car while also having Google Maps directions.
Android introduced this (anti-)feature called "audio focus".  The issue is when
an app doesn't implement audio focus functionality, the default is to never
allow another application to have such a thing.

PowerAmp seems to allow it, so I am unsure how the audio focus mechanism
actually works since I implemented my own media player app.  It's possible I
don't know how it actually works, or perhaps PowerAmp replaces the AudioManager
service in some way.

My solution is to compile my own ROM so I can override the broken AudioManager
behavior.

Compiling ROM (`brunch bullhead`)

Problems with packages:

	emerge --ask schedtool imagemagick repo
	eselect python set python2.7

Those were the packages not installed on my system.  Not the full extent.  The
repo tool uses python2.7, and the repository itself also needs it.

Need to extract binary blobs because my ROM didn't include Tycho.apk (and
probably others.  Before extracting and after mounting the image, do:

	chown -R kandiyohi:kandiyohi system/
	cd system
	ln -sf . vendor

To allow permissions to create the file (that extract.sh needs) and to fix the
broken symlink vendor pointing to /vendor.
